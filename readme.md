***************** Learn Laravel *******************

Hi, My name is Harendra. I am new to web development and I am a self learner. I have created this repository just to learn laravel.. I have also subscribed to laracasts Video Series from laracasts.com and downloaded the video tutorials from there..

Now I will be learning laravel by following with the video Series (Given in the video series "Laravel 5.4 From Scratch" ) and creating my own project.

I will also be commiting my progress to the Git repository after completing a video lesson.

By the way if you want to follow the series you can download it from this link "https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2017". Off course you need to subscribe to it first..

Question- Who can benefit from this repository??

Answer- Anyone who is also following this Series from laracasts.com and want to learn laravel along with me.

Thanks, Harendra
